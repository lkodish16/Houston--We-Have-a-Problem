1) How well does the game accomplish what you set out to do?
I think this game definitely accomplished what I set out to do. I didn't want do something that was too large of a scale, and possibly to large to finish, so I think I found a nice balance with this game. There's nine rooms, five puzzle (most of which are fairly small and connected), an NPC, and numerous descriptions. I had a vision for this game when I first brainstormed what I wanted to do, and to see it come together in the end is pretty satisfying. I was able to fit everything I had initially planned to put in the game, so this game stayed true to what I originally thought it was going to be. 

2) Discuss a time when you got stuck, and how you got unstuck. 
There were numerous times where I got stuck when it came to code. I couldn't figure out how to add things such as custom verbs, but I don't really count that as I time where I got myself unstuck since I got the code to fix those problems from other students or the inform handbook. A time where I got myself unstuck was when I had to figure out how to make a hidden item. I didn't want the player to be able to just enter "take all", and take all of the items in the room, even ones he hadn't discovered yet, so I figured out I could create an item, but not give it a location, and then bring it into the room once the player fulfilled a certain action, such as looking under the bed.

3) Describe each of the required three puzzles in your game and how to solve each puzzle.

The first puzzle appearing in my game is trying to figure out what's wrong with the engine. Unless the player finds out what is wrong with the engine and how they can fix it, they're pretty much stuck. In the crew's quarters, if the player looks under their bed, they will find an auto-mechanic. If turned on in a room other than the maintenance room, the auto-mechanic will not work. However, if the player turns it on in the maintenance room, then it will inform the player what is wrong with the engine, and exactly what they need in order to fix it.

One of my puzzles was figuring out how to unlock the door in the mess hall to get to the kitchen. If the player examined the security monitors in the command room, they would see a book that would otherwise not appear in the room. If the player takes and reads the book, it will say that they can lock pick a door with a scalpel, which the player can find in the medical bay. They can then lock pick the kitchen door, granting them access to the kitchen.

Another one of my puzzles was a combining puzzle. After the player gives the sandwich to the astronaut and receives the space suit, they may try to go out into the space, but they will suffocate and die without any oxygen running through the suit. If they combine the space suit with the oxygen tank, which can be found in the airlock, they will create an oxygen enhanced space suit, which allows the player to go out onto the wing of the spaceship without suffocating.

4) Discuss the gameplay mechanics in your game and how they improve the user's experience.
Trying to examine things and not receiving any text in return is something that can really ruin a player's experience, so I gave a lot of descriptions so the player shouldn't be examining things and not receiving a description back.
I also think the setting of the game improves the user's experience. I made the rooms true to what you would expect to be on the types of spaceship you would see in a show like start trek or firefly, and I think the whole idea of actually being able to go out into space is enticing to the user.  

5) Discuss the beta testing process: Who tested your game? 
Mr. Kiang tested my game. His feedback definitely affected my game because he found a lot of things that needed fixing, and I realized I needed to fix a lot of things while he was playing through the game. I didn't test anyone's game since my partner was Mr. Kiang. 

6) What are you most proud of?
I'm most proud of the adjustments I made to create a better experience for the player. Mr. Kiang's beta-testing and suggestions really helped me think about what the game would be like for a first time player, instead of thinking about the game as the creator. After the beta-testing, I removed some parts (such as a combining puzzle that would have been confusing to the player), added more descriptions to things the player might try to examine, changed the descriptions of rooms after the player had accomplished a certain action in that room, and fixed any bugs found during the beta testing. If I could do something differently, I would probably start on the puzzles and general outline of the game first, before spending time on the descriptions. I should have made the puzzles and bug fixes my first priority. It was still high on my list of things to do, but I found that adding a bunch of descriptions would be the first thing I would do after creating a new room.

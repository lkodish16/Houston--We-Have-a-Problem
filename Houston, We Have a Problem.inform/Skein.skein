The ringing of your alarm clock wakes you up. You get out of bed to find that none of your fellow crew members are in the crew&apos;s quarters. They probably just went to breakfast. You had hoped for a cushy engineering job on Earth, but the UNSA had other plans for your career. It&apos;s been two years since you were assigned to this ship, and your team hasn&apos;t been able to find any sign of alien life in the cosmos. As you change from your pajamas into your uniform, you hear a loud voice booming from the intercom.

Houston, We Have a Problem
An Interactive Fiction by Leo Kodish
Release 1 / Serial number 140312 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Crew&apos;s Quarters
This is the room you have shared with your fellow astronauts for the last two years. The room is large enough to fit the twenty or so beds needed to accommodate all of the astronauts on the ship. You don&apos;t have a bedside desk or anything like that, so you&apos;ve had to keep your things under your bed. 
The Maintenance Room is to your west.

Maintenance Room
The room that holds the engine of the space ship. The lights are flashing red, giving the impression that something might have gone wrong with the engine. 
The Crew&apos;s Quarters are to the East. The Mess Hall is to the North, and the Observation Deck is to the West.

ATTENTION! This is an emergency UNSA broadcast. Most of your crewmates have safely evacuated the ship on escape pods, but if anyone is still aboard this ship, your engine has malfunctioned, and will explode unless it is fixed. We have sent a rescue team to save any crew members who may still be aboard the ship, but we predict the engine to explode before we can reach you, so you must fix the engine in order to give us enough time to save you.

This is a room in the ship where people go to relax. It has some comfortable sofas for people to sit on, and they face a large plate of glass that acts as a window.

Observation Deck
This is a room in the ship where people go to relax. It has some comfortable sofas for people to sit on, and they face a large plate of glass that acts as a window. If you look through the window, you can see the wing of the spaceship, as well as the infinite cosmos you have been traveled through for the last two years. 
The Medical Bay is to the West. The Airlock is to the North. The Command Room is to the South, and the Maintenance Room is to the East.

You thought you were the only person left on the ship, but you see a very hungry looking astronaut sitting down at one of the tables.

ATTENTION! This is an emergency UNSA broadcast.
